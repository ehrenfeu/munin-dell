DESCRIPTION

    A Munin plugin to graph the fan speeds and chassis temperatures of Dell
    hardware. Requires Dell's OpenManage software, specifically omreport. OMSA
    services must be started prior to plugins use. Script expects omreport to
    be in /usr/sbin/, you may need to add a symlink.

    omreport accesses the proc filesystem and as such this plugin must be ran
    as root. Alternatively, you could modify script to use sudoers, or setuid.

    To run script as root add the following lines to munin's plugin-conf.d dir.

    [dell*]
    user root
    group root
